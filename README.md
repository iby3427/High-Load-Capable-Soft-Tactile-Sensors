# High-Load-Capable-Soft-Tactile-Sensors

This is the source code of the paper "High-Load-Capable Soft Tactile Sensors: Incorporating Magnetorheological Elastomer for Accurate Contact Detection and Classification of Asymmetric Mechanical Components," submitted in Advanced Intelligent Systems.

Jupyter Notebook "Codes.ipynb" is a code using Scikit-learn for making DL models presented in a paper. It is recommended to run in 'Google Colab' environment.

Excel file "Sensor_data.xlsx" is a calibrated data compensating Soft/Hard-Iron effects.

Colab has been used for the environment of learning process.
